# Clipper2-java
A Java port of _[Clipper2](https://github.com/AngusJohnson/Clipper2)_.

### Port Info
* _tangiblesoftwaresolutions_' C# to Java Converter did the heavy lifting (but then a lot of manual work was required).
* Currently passes 118 of the first 120 polygon tests; some of the test cases thereafter seem to get stuck in while loop.
